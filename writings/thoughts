# General thoughts and Ideas

Would be good to have generalised events. For example a Change event whenever
the model changes or the heirarchy is modified.

this.on("Change");

When to validate Views?
	- sync --Before sending to server
	- addChild --Want child to validate before adding to tree.
	- init? --May not have data yet.


Flow:
new View -> init() -> render()
		          \. added to tree

# Problems
- Have to manually unserialize
- Posting with ENTER key
